For testing, you have to execute the script named ```scriptSQL.sql``` with a MySQL database.
Also, open the script contained in the backend, go to the lines 50 and 51, and fill ```user``` and ```password``` with your MySQL credentials.

For executing the Back-End, just write in the command-line, within the backend folder, ```node index.js```.
For executing the Front-End, see the instructions of the file ```README.md``` contained in the folder ```films```.
